This is my **first-ever programming project**, created during my first semester in college. It is a simple front-end website for an **Online Book Store** called "Fairy Tail," developed using **HTML** and **CSS** only.

- A **Login** and **Register** page.  
- A **Home page** showcasing books and their categories.  
- A **section for Dr. Mostafa Mahmoud**, displaying his books and information about him.  
- Detailed book pages, providing information, cover images, and descriptions.
